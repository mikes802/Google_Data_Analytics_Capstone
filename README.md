# Google Data Analytics Capstone
My case study to complete the [Google Data Analytics Certificate](https://grow.google/certificates/data-analytics/#?modal_active=none) course. 

After months of learning exciting concepts, all of which were new for me, through the Google Data Analytics Certificate course, it's time to put my knowledge and skills to the test with a capstone project: the data analysis case study.

To accomplish this and answer the business question, I will need to follow the data analysis process: __ask, prepare, process, analyze, share,__ and __act.__ It has been a long journey but I know this is just the beginning.
