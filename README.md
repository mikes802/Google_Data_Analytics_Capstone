# Google Data Analytics Capstone
My case study to complete the [Google Data Analytics Certificate](https://grow.google/certificates/data-analytics/#?modal_active=none) course. 

After months of learning exciting concepts, all of which were new for me, through the Google Data Analytics Certificate course, it's time to put my knowledge and skills to the test with a capstone project: the data analysis case study.

To accomplish this and answer the business question, I will need to follow the data analysis process: __ask, prepare, process, analyze, share,__ and __act.__ It has been a long journey but I know this is just the beginning.

## Scenario
From the case study:
> You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at [Bellabeat](https://bellabeat.com/), a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. You have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. You will present your analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with your high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.
## Data
This data is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit), which contains the following description:
> These datasets were generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID (column A) or timestamp (column B). Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.
