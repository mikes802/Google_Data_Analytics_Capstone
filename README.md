# Google_Data_Analytics_Capstone
My case study to complete the Google Data Analytics Certificate course. 

After months of learning exciting concepts, all of which were new for me, through the Google Data Analytics Certificate course, it's time to put my knowledge and skills to the test with a capstone project: the data analysis case study.

To accomplish this and answer the business question, I will need to follow the data analysis process: __ask, prepare, process, analyze, share,__ and __act.__ It has been a long journey but I know this is just the beginning.

## Scenario
From the case study:
> You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. You have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. You will present your analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with your high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.
