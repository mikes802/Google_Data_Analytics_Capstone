# Post-Analysis
## Share
My goal now is to make a clean, convincing presentation that I will give to Urska Srsen and Sando Mur, the founders of Bellabeat.
### Guiding Questions
*Were you able to answer the business questions?*

Our business task was:
>Identify insight into consumer use trends of smart devices that will inform Bellabeatâ€™s marketing strategy for one Bellabeat product.

Through my analysis, I believe that I have gained insight into consumer use trends that can give the marketing team a path to a new marketing strategy.

*What story does your data tell?*

When analyzing sleep records, the data showed that there were two distinct groups, those who tracked sleep moderately or frequently, and those who rarely tracked their sleep or didn't at all. I then found that the second group, those who rarely tracked their sleep or didn't at all, had significantly more sedentary minutes on average than the first group. The first group, on the other hand, mostly fell within a fairly tight range of sedentary minutes. The data seems to show a significant relationship between sedentary minutes and sleep tracking.

*How do your findings relate to your original question?*

These findings indicate a trend in consumer use of this smart device. Those that fall within that range of sedentary minutes tend to track their sleep. Those who fall beyond that range tend not to track their sleep. These insights could help Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

*Can data visualization help you share your findings?*

Data visualization will help me tell this story in a direct, impactful way.
### Key Tasks

1. Determine the best way to share your findings.

I will create a presentation using Microsoft Powerpoint. I will be able to show my findings and visuals clearly and cleanly.

2. Create effective data visualizations.

To share the most significant value differences between Group A and Group B, the two groups I mentioned above, I think simple bar graphs with simple annotation should suffice. I downloaded the relevant data from BigQuery into csv files and will use Excel to intially create the bar graphs. I will then copy them into Powerpoint where I can edit and enhance them visually, showing the percent change, etc. I chose to only make four bar graphs based on four values, representing the largest discrepancies between the two groups. I think this is cleaner and more compelling than using the graph I generated during my analysis.

The most significant discrepancy is between the average sedentary minutes from both groups. I want to show my scatter plot with the trendline, but I think the graph itself looks weak after I paste it into Powerpoint. I will use Tableau to see if I can make a more visually pleasing scatter plot. To do this, I will first download to csv the resultant values that were returned from my last query in BigQuery. I will then upload that dataset into Tableau. I will then do the following:

1. Click on `Id` so that this is the dimension.
2. Drag `Avg Sed Min` to the Columns field so that it is my x axis.
3. Drag `Number Sleep Days` to the Rows field so that it is y axis.
4. Drag `Id` to the Detail box so that the Id's appear as plot points on the graph.
5. Drag `Avg Sed Min` to the color box so that I can adjust the color of the plot points to show a color shift from red to blue as they move up in sedentary minutes.
6. Add a trend line through the Analytics tab.

I will copy the graph to Powerpoint and add clear axis labels. The result is below:

3. Present your findings.

I will bring my findings and visuals together into my final presentation.

### Guiding Questions
*What is your final conclusion based on your analysis?*

Given the high correlation coefficient between the number of days with sleep records and average sedentary minutes, my conclusion is that this is a significant trend that requires further analysis with much larger datasets.

*How could your team and business apply your insights?*

These initial and subsequent findings could be used to drive marketing strategy. For example, the company could market sleep tracking functionality to customers who track daily activity with Bellabeat wearables and maintain an average number of sedentary minutes that fall within the range discovered by this analysis. On the other hand, it's possible that promoting sleep tracking to customers who maintain high average sedentary minutes could possibly encourage them to reduce their sedentary activities, promote their health, and drive customer loyalty.   

*What next steps would you or your stakeholders take based on your findings?*

1. Gather more data to conduct a thorough analysis. The introduction given for this data proclaimed that there were 30 participants. Initial analysis showed that there were 33. According to the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in the field of probability and statistics, 30 is the minimum sample size we need so that our results represent the average result of a population. This data barely covered that requirement. I believe a more robust sample size would give us much needed clarity in terms of the relationship between variables.
2. If the initial insights bear out through further data collection and analysis, another step would be to investigate the relationship between sleep tracking and time doing sedentary activities. This could give fruit to some valuable insight that could not only help Bellabeat's business, but could further their work to "empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits".

*Is there additional data you could use to expand on your findings?*

Further data would be required to bear out the results of this initial study. Also, as I mentioned above, more data in other areas may need to be collected in order to investigate the relationship between sleep tracking and time doing sedentary activities. Is there another variable that is at work here and what role does it play? This data may not be easily available or tied to any health data the company already collects on its customers. Perhaps data collection through surveys would need to be taken to bring in information on new variables, which could lead to new insights.

On to presentation.
